## LunchBox Hello ADC
___

### Description

This example code provides function and register settings for reading analog data. This code converts the analog value provided by potentiometer into a corresponding 10 bit digital value. The converted digital value is then used to change the brightness of an external LED using PWM.

### Hardware needed

Potentiometer (100 k), Resistor (330 ohms), LED,  Breadboard, Connecting wires.

### Connections

Pin 1.6 of LunchBox is connected to anode of LED through a resistor of 1 kohm and cathode to Ground. 
Pin 1.0 of LunchBox is connected to Analog pin (middle pin) of potentiometer and the other two ends are connected to Vcc and Ground respectively.
